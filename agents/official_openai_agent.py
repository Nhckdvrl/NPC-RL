    NewOpenAIAgent is a new implementation for API Track of the Sony CPDC 2025 Challenge. 
    
    This agent takes in information from the dialogue, the functions, and the background of the scenario, 
    e.g. worldview, persona, role, etc., and generates corresponding function calls and text responses. 
    The function information has already been converted from langchain.tools to the OpenAI function calling format 
    using the method `convert_to_openai_function`, to simplify the implementation. 
    For details of the function calls, please refer to the `function_calls` directory.

        This method is the entry point called by the evaluator. It is implemented with the following steps: 
        
        1. Prepare prompts for function calling. This has been much simplified by the `convert_to_openai_function` by langchain. 
        2. Call the OpenAI API to generate the necessary function calls. 
        3. Use the `executor` to obtain the function call results.
